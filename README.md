# Prime-factors
In the number range [L, R], find the number that has the maximum number of prime factors, and if there is more than one such number, find the greatest one.
In number theory, prime factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into a product of prime integers.
E.â€‰g. the number 24 has 4 prime factors: 2, 2, 2, 3.

Input :
Two integers L, R (0 < L < R < 10^7).

Output :
Output the number x that has the maximum number of prime factors and belongs to the interval [L, R].
If there are multiple numbers with the same number of factors, output the maximum one.
